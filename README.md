# Archade-game
In this game, there's a Player and Enemies (bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies.  The player can move left, right, up and down while the enemies move at varying speeds on the paved block portion of the game board. Once the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the starting square and Once the player reaches the water (i.e., the top of the game board), the game is won.
